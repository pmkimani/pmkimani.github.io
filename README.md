# Paulson Kimani SPU Student
Hello, I am Paulson Kimani. I am a junior year student at Seattle Pacific University. My hobbies include coding, photography, and road trips.

## Coding and Hobbies
The coding languages that I like to use most are Python, Javascript, and C++. I like them in that order, due to language features, and simplicity.
