# Paulson Kimani, SPU Student, Spring 2024
Hello, I am Paulson Kimani. I am a junior year student at Seattle Pacific University. My hobbies include coding, photography, and road trips.

## Coding and Hobbies
The coding languages that I like to use most are Python, Javascript, and C++. I like them in that order, due to language features, and simplicity.

## Career Goals
I want to be a software developer because it will allow me to use my skills in coding. Also, I am passionate about Information Technology, so either is acceptable to me.
