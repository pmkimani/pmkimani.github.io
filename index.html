    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Paulson Kimani. I am a junior year student at Seattle Pacific University. My hobbies include coding, photography, and road trips.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The coding languages that I like to use most are Python, Javascript, and C++. I like them in that order, due to language features, and simplicity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I also like web frameworks such as Node.js since that is essential to building modern web applications.</p>
