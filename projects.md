# Internship
  At F5, I was hired as a software developer intern, and I was assinged a personal project that I worked on during the duration of my internship.
  My objective was to manage personal resources under actual industry or research time and budget constraints.
  While I was there, I gained skills and knowledge to help prepare for my post-graduation career
  I attended and actively engaged in Agile and Scrum daily stand-ups to better integrate my tasks with the team and receive feedback from supervisors.
  I reviewed company software design guidelines and documentation so that I write code that conforms and meets their standards.
